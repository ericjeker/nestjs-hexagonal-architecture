# Nest.js - Onion Architecture

## Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean repository using the Onion Architecture in the 
[Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. To read more about my explanations on this 
architecture, head over to my blog [post](https://wowww.ch).

This example is strongly inspired from the official video [courses](https://courses.nestjs.com/). To dive deeper and get more 
hands-on experience just go there and buy their courses, they are excellent, and they explore many 
other concepts and architectures like CQRS, Event Sourcing, etc. ðŸ’¡

## Requisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - The Best Package Manager.
- [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) - The Best Node.js Framework.

(yes, this is strongly opinionated ðŸ˜‰)

The project will create a SQLite database in the root folder.
